# Online Resume Builder Application 

Creating a resume is a bit tedious task for any working professional from any industry. One has to keep it short, simple, and with the latest work experience, and constantly update it over a while.

## High-Level Approach

- Create a basic client-server setup of Node & React and install necessary libraries required.
- Build a React form by making modularized components using Material UI or React-Boostrap & calling these components in sequence to get required input data to generate resume.
- Process the information on the server(Node) and using some HTML to PDF libraries to generate the resume.
- Finally, make it auto-download on client side.
